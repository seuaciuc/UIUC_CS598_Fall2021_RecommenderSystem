The app can be run [here](https://share.streamlit.io/seuaciuc/uiuc_cs598_fall2021_recommendersystem/main/main.py).  

To run the app locally:  
  
1. Make sure all the files are in the same directory (your working directory). This includes `main.py`, `ratings.dat`, and `movieRatings.pkl`.
2. From a terminal, from the working directory, run `streamlit run main.py`. This should start a local Streamlit server on a new tab on your default browser.
